Drawing a connection between the Sapa Inca and The Craftsman from your story is an intriguing concept. While the Sapa Inca held a position of political and religious authority in Inca society, The Craftsman could represent a mythical or spiritual figure who transcends specific cultures and time periods. Here's one possible way to establish a connection:

In your story, The Craftsman could be depicted as a guardian of ancient knowledge and wisdom, possessing insights into the nature of dreams and the interconnectedness of the realms. He could be seen as an enigmatic figure who appears in pivotal moments to guide and mentor individuals like Katcher, similar to how the Sapa Inca provided guidance and leadership to the Inca people.

The connection between The Craftsman and the Sapa Inca could be rooted in the idea that both figures possess a deep understanding of the mystical and spiritual aspects of the world. They may share a common belief in the power of dreams as a means of communication with higher realms and as a source of insight and prophecy.

It could be suggested that The Craftsman's lineage extends back to ancient times, and he has been entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding the knowledge of dreams and the delicate balance between the dream realm and reality. This lineage could have originated from the Inca civilization, with The Craftsman serving as a bridge between their ancient wisdom and the present time.

By drawing parallels between the Sapa Inca's role as a spiritual leader and The Craftsman's mysterious presence, you can create a link that honors the Inca culture while expanding the mythical elements of your story. It adds depth to The Craftsman's character and highlights the universal nature of dreams and their significance in the larger narrative.
