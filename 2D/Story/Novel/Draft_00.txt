### Chapter 01 : Rude Awakening ###

	"Katcher! Wake up, Katcher! Please wake up. You're bleeding, Katcher! You 
need to wake up!"

	Katcher woke abruptly in the middle of the night, breathing heavily and in 
pain. His ribs felt as if he'd been kicked by a horse and above his right eye 
began a line of blood that ran down the length of his cheek. The wounds felt 
familiar to him but along with the memories of the newly disturbed dream, the 
pain quickly faded away. By morning all that remained was a spot of blood on his 
pillow-case and an itching desire to know where it had come from and, most of 
all,  whose voice it had been that woke him.

	The next morning started out like any other. Katcher woke alone in his cabin, 
far away from the sounds of modern society. He brewed a fresh cup of coffee atop 
his wood-lit stove and  went out of his cabin for an early meditation with the 
rising sun. The roaring screams of city life and military bases that had once 
plagued him had been replaced with countless and complex stories coming from the 
within the fields, rivers, and forests surrounding the cabin. Stories of birds 
singing beautifully to their mates, deer scraping their antlers against trees as 
they shed themselves of their velvet, and the noisy workings of beavers as they 
repair a hole in the dam they had worked so hard to build. If you listened 
closely, you can hear a mother eagle in her nest on the distant mountainside, 
looking after her eggs that are soon to hatch. Katcher happened upon her nest 
once while climbing the mountain-range.  The sight of her nearly scared him off 
the rock wall, but her calm response to his abrupt arrival assured him that 
she'd meant no harm. In fact, it felt as if she welcomed Katchers presence. It's 
strange, but most of the wildlife in the area acted in much the same when 
Katcher was around.
/* Visualize encounters with nature. From Squirrels to Wolves and Bears */.
Katcher wasn't yet aware, but the world around him was calling his name.  
Something was coming, something bad, and the world needs Katcher to be ready for 
when it arrives.
/* Note the perspective shift from 'was coming' to 'the world needs'. I want to 
hint to the idea that the narration is coming from a point in the future, but 
some time before "the Arrival" */
/* Also, what the hell is arriving?  That had nohting to do with my original 
storyline, haha */

	"Katcher! Wake Up!.....".
Katcher snapped out of his meditation. There was that voice again. And with it, 
a brief and fleeting memory of what the dream had been about. "How long was 
I..?" Katcher looked around, confused and trembling. In his hands was a now 
ice-cold cup of coffee, but the sun was still early on the rise. Almost 
identical to how it was when he first sat down. But these thoughts were too 
illusive to focus on and Katcher wrote the whole thing off as a werid 
side-effect from the meal he had eaten the night before. There must have been 
something strange about the mushrooms that the old women at the market sold to 
him on his last visit. Besides, there was a lot that needed to be done and the 
short meditation session meant for more time that Katcher could be working. 

	The cabin was pristine. All of the lumber had been hand cut and constructed 
with the craftsmanship of a master woodsmith.  The four corners of the structure 
were attached firmly  to the trunks of nearby trees, and in the 5 years of it's 
existance, the cabin had been lifted nearly a foot off the ground.
/* How fast can trees grow? */
Doorways, windowframes, gables and interior-supports were crafted from a 
beautifully dark wood that Katcher had found on the far side of the river, a 
mile to the south. It took Katcher all three months, while the river was low, to 
bring enough wood back to the cabin. And another years time before it would all 
be hand-carved and skillfully assembled. With the dense trees around, and the 
natural color-tone of it's construction, the cabin was nearly invisible from a 
far. It was as if the cabin had grown there on its own, designed by the trees 
themselves. The inside of the cabin mimiced this natural design. Much of the 
furniture had been woven into the floor and walls as if the entire cabin grew 
from a single system of roots. The paintings and dream-catchers that decorated 
the walls were suspended from branches that meticulously reached out and danced 
along the walls, to the four pillar-trees that held the whole thing together.  
If Katcher wasn't meditating, foraging, or training then he was certain to be 
working on the cabin. This cabin meant everything to him, for it was all he had 
left. The care and attention he gave the cabin borded on the insane and 
obsessive, but that wasn't quite the case. Katcher kept his mind and his body 
active for  every waking minute because he could no longer handle where his 
thoughts and memories would wander otherwise.  He couldn't bare the awareness of 
the stories filling his past; the people he lost, and the things he was forced 
to do to survive. A life of constant activity, struggle, and focus was the only 
thing that kept his mind silent. It took Katcher all of these last 5 years to 
settle into this new flow of life.  Things were finally begining to feel like 
something he could call normal, perhaps even a home. That is, until the voice 
came back. Until it was time for Katcher to wake up!

### Chapter 02: To the Market ###

	The nearest village was more than a days walk away. The walk back could take 
as long as three days, if the weather was bad or if Katcher needed to haul a 
large load of materials. One winter, in preparation for a blizzard, Katcher had 
to make the trip three times within a week, just to have enough material to 
survive the storm. 

	It's been years since Katcher visited the village enough to be a familiar 
face. The dense beard and wild hair masked the identity of the onece awaited 
visiter. Katcher had made it clear with his absense that he wanted to be left 
alone. The village he once loved to visit was now no more than a task to be 
done, a reason for Katchers time to be occupied.
These days he'd only go into the village when materials were low, tools needed 
repair, or when the season was right for him to plant new seeds and spores 
throughout the forest. But this trip was different. Katcher didn't need any 
textiles, his tools were sharp and strong, the vast pantry was full and the 
crops were thriving. Katcher was afraid that he may have been losing his mind.  
It had been a month since the first dream and they've been happening every day 
since.

	The dream always started out the same way, the moment Katcher layed down of 
	sat for meditation, he'd fall deeply into an abyss and land somewhere 
	familiar.
