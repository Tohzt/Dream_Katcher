Katcher's father being drawn to the region of Manu National Park in Peru due to 
his military involvement provides an intriguing backstory. Here's a possible 
scenario that connects his military service to his connection with the jungle:

During his time in the military, Katcher's father, let's call him John, was 
part of a special operations unit specializing in jungle warfare. He was 
deployed to various regions around the world, gaining extensive knowledge and 
experience in surviving and operating in dense jungles.

One of John's missions led him to South America, where he was assigned to 
assist a local military group in combating illegal activities, such as drug 
trafficking and deforestation, within the Manu National Park. As he immersed 
himself in the lush jungle, John developed a deep appreciation for its beauty, 
biodiversity, and the unique challenges it presented.

During his stay, John witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of human 
activities on the delicate ecosystem. He saw the destructive consequences of 
illegal logging, wildlife poaching, and the encroachment of civilization on 
the pristine rainforest. This experience awakened a strong desire within him 
to protect and preserve the natural wonders of the jungle.

As John continued his military career, he actively sought opportunities to 
return to the region, whether through specialized training programs, joint 
operations, or research projects. His dedication to understanding and 
safeguarding the jungle's secrets grew with each visit, and he became known 
among his peers as an expert in jungle survival and conservation.

Eventually, John reached a point in his military career where he decided to 
retire and devote himself fully to his passion for the jungle. He settled near 
Manu National Park, establishing a modest cabin surrounded by the lush greenery 
he had come to cherish. Here, he immersed himself in studying the flora and 
fauna, honing his survival skills, and practicing sustainable living.

John's love for the jungle and his extensive knowledge became the foundation 
for the teachings he passed down to his son, Katcher. Through their shared 
experiences and exploration of the rainforest, Katcher learned about the 
importance of environmental stewardship, the interconnectivity of all living 
things, and the delicate balance between humanity and nature.

The military connection not only explains John's presence in the region but 
also adds depth to his character and motivates his unwavering commitment to 
protecting the jungle. It serves as a catalyst for his eventual retirement and 
the transmission of his knowledge and values to his son, Katcher.

military service to focus on raising Katcher during his early years. Sarah and 
John enjoy a few blissful years together as a family, cherishing their time

During a high-risk military operation authorized by Colonel Ramirez, Sarah and 
Lucid's mother, both brave and skilled soldiers, lose their lives. Colonel 
Ramirez feels a deep sense of guilt and responsibility for the loss of Sarah

Sarah's death deeply affects John, leaving him devastated and grappling with 
the challenges of single parenthood. He must now navigate the world of 
parenthood alone, raising Katcher with the memories and values that he and 
Sarah had instilled in him.

As for Lucid, his mother's death is a significant part of his backstory, 
highlighting the shared tragedy between him and Katcher. The details of Lucid's 
mother's sacrifice and the connection between their losses can be explored and 
revealed gradually throughout the story, adding depth and complexity to their
