Name:			Lucid - Antagonist
Age:			Identical to Katcher (16-22)
Status:		Loved by many
Location:	Wealthy Traveler - somehow always near Katcher

Backstory:
	Born into wealth, Lucid has never known life without a silver spoon.  He is 
	the exact same age as Katcher, down to the second. This happenchance is why 
	The Craftsman doesn't know about him or his intentions.
	From birth, Lucid has been aware of Katcher without knowing him directly. it 
	is his time of birth and proximity to Katcher that allows him to see into 
	Katchers life whenever The Craftsman intervenes.
	Lucid is aware that Katcher is the chosen one, and his jealousy guides his 
	lust for power. He fears that killing Katcher will expose his plans and 
	potentially destroy his chance to take The Craftsmans place. 

Flaws:
	Stubborn - will not take advice from those who know better than he
	Pride - Believes that he is destined to rule by means of birth-rite
	Selfish - Unwilling to part with anything that is "his"


Struggles:
	The desire to be loved conflicts with the lust for power
	Hates his power-driven father and doesn't recognize the irony


Spoilers:
	At the end of the story, Katcher chooses to trust Lucid with the fate of the 
	world. Katcher maintains the ability to intervene, if ever Lucid decides to 
	betray him again.
