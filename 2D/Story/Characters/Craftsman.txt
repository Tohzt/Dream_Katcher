Name: 		The Craftsman
Age:			Old - Possibly primordial
Status:		Unknown
Location:	Unknow origin
Backstory:
	The Craftsman appears to be all-knowing
	Aware of Katchers importance and what is happening to him
	The bridge between dreams and reality
	Creator of the magical/powerful dreamcatchers


Flaws:
	Unable or unwilling to fix/save the world himself

Struggles:
	 The Craftsman must pass on his powers in order to keep the world in order.  
	Doing so passes on the life of loneliness to whomever takes this task. The 
	Craftsman could force this upon someone, but is unwilling to do so, for a 
	willing soul is less likely to faulter. However, as The Craftsman ages he 
	becomes blind to his abilities to see the world for what it really is. He 
	risks losing control of the bridge between realities, the bridge that holds 
	the balance between Order and Chaos.
	 Will The Craftsman find Katcher in time? Will Katcher willingly accept his 
	fate?
