Tragic History:
	Katcher didn't abandon society alone. After finding out about secret 
	government plans, he and his late wife were forced on the run for their 
	lives.
	Their survival experience and training made this easy for a couple years.  
	They were eventually discovered (fighting in a resistance?) and she died 
	sacrificing herself so Katcher could escape.
	This loss feuls Katchers nightmares. But it's been 3 years and Katcher has 
	been repressing the memory for so long that his dreams are more convincing.  
	He doesn't frequent the nearby villages as often as he used to.
